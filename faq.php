  <ul>
    <li class="q" data-icon="+">DOES OPEN FARM USE ANY MEAT OR POULTRY MEALS?</li>
    <li class="a">We do not use any meat or poultry meals due to their lack of regulation and traceability. Meat and poultry meals are made in large batches and may contain meat from diseased animals, disabled animals that may carry infections, or have been fed antibiotics and growth hormones. Instead, we use a small batch, ocean caught whitefish meal, so we have full traceability and can guarantee the fish have lived a natural life and have not been fed antibiotics or artificial feeds.</li>
    <li class="q" data-icon="+">WHAT DOES ‘NATURAL FLAVOURING’ MEAN?</li>
    <li class="a">Our natural flavor ingredient is dehydrated whitefish that is in a powder form and is preserved with mixed tocopherols (Vitamin E) and a touch of salt.</li>
    <li class="q" data-icon="+">DO YOUR MEAT INGREDIENTS CONTAIN ANTIBIOTICS OR HORMONES?</li>
    <li class="a">No, our poultry and meat are raised without the use of antibiotics and growth hormones. Our fish is always ocean caught, meaning it consumed a natural and antibiotic free diet.</li>
    <li class="q" data-icon="+">DOES OPEN FARM CONTAIN ARTIFICIAL FLAVORS OR PRESERVATIVES SUCH AS ETHOXYQUIN?</li>
    <li class="a">Open Farm recipes are free from artificial preservatives and flavors–including Ethoxyquin. Instead, we pay a significant premium to use a Natural antioxidant that is formulated with a proprietary blend of mixed tocopherols (Vitamin E) that also provides anti-oxidants.</li>
